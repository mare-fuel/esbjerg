## Discussion
During the second project meeting with the project partners and the advisory board it was consensus that the fuel demand side will not be a limiting factor for the economic production of electrofuels in Esbjerg. Thus, the MarE-Fuel project will not continue deriving high resolution fuel demand profiles for relevant ports around the North Sea area.
